# Parallel Connections

Establish multiple network connections concurrently for improved performance and reliability.

## Overview

Parallel connection establishment allows you to connect to multiple servers simultaneously, significantly reducing the total time required to establish connections. This feature is particularly useful for applications that need to connect to multiple endpoints or implement load balancing strategies.

## Key Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: Establish connections concurrently instead of sequentially
- **Better Reliability**: Multiple connection attempts increase success probability
- **Load Balancing**: Connect to multiple servers for redundancy
- **Configurable Concurrency**: Control the number of simultaneous connections

## Basic Usage

### Simple Parallel Connection

```swift
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

// Connect to multiple servers in parallel
let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 5
)

print("Established \(connections.count) connections")
```

### Parallel Connection with Retry

```swift
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

// Connect in parallel with retry strategy
let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 3,
    retryStrategy: .exponential(
        initialDelay: .seconds(1),
        maxDelay: .seconds(10)
    )
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Load Balancing with Parallel Connections

```swift
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

// Define multiple server endpoints for load balancing
let loadBalancedServers = [
    ServerLocation(host: "server1.example.com", port: 443, enableTLS: true, cacheKey: "lb-1"),
    ServerLocation(host: "server2.example.com", port: 443, enableTLS: true, cacheKey: "lb-2"),
    ServerLocation(host: "server3.example.com", port: 443, enableTLS: true, cacheKey: "lb-3"),
    ServerLocation(host: "server4.example.com", port: 443, enableTLS: true, cacheKey: "lb-4")
]

// Connect to all servers in parallel
let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: loadBalancedServers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 4
)

// Use connections for load balancing
for connection in connections {
    // Distribute load across connections
    await performOperation(connection)
}
```

### Parallel Connection with Custom Error Handling

```swift
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

// Custom retry strategy for parallel connections
let customStrategy = RetryStrategy.custom { attempt, error in
    // Don't retry on authentication errors
    if error is AuthenticationError {
        return nil
    }
    
    // Exponential backoff for network errors
    if error is NetworkError {
        let delay = min(pow(2.0, Double(attempt)), 15.0)
        return .seconds(delay)
    }
    
    // Fixed delay for other errors
    if attempt < 3 {
        return .seconds(2.0)
    }
    
    return nil
}

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 5,
    retryStrategy: customStrategy
)
```

### Monitoring Parallel Connection Progress

```swift
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

// Track connection progress
var successfulConnections: [ChildChannelService<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>] = []
var failedConnections: [String] = []

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 3
)

// Analyze results
for connection in connections {
    if connection != nil {
        successfulConnections.append(connection!)
    } else {
        failedConnections.append(connection?.config.cacheKey ?? "unknown")
    }
}

print("Successful connections: \(successfulConnections.count)")
print("Failed connections: \(failedConnections.count)")
```

## Configuration Options

### Max Concurrent Connections

```swift
// Conservative concurrency for limited resources
let conservativeConnections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 2
)

// Aggressive concurrency for high-performance scenarios
let aggressiveConnections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 10
)
```

### Retry Strategy Integration

```swift
// Different retry strategies for different scenarios
let fastRetry = RetryStrategy.fixed(delay: .seconds(1))
let robustRetry = RetryStrategy.exponential(
    initialDelay: .seconds(1),
    maxDelay: .seconds(30),
    multiplier: 2.0,
    jitter: 0.1
)

// Use appropriate strategy based on requirements
let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 5,
    retryStrategy: robustRetry
)
```

## Best Practices

### Choose Appropriate Concurrency Level

```swift
// Calculate optimal concurrency based on server count and resources
let optimalConcurrency = min(
    servers.count,           // Don't exceed server count
    max(2, servers.count / 2), // At least 2, half of server count
    10                       // Maximum 10 concurrent connections
)

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: optimalConcurrency
)
```

### Handle Partial Failures

```swift
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 5
)

// Handle partial connection failures
let successfulConnections = connections.compactMap { $0 }
let failedCount = connections.count - successfulConnections.count

if failedCount > 0 {
    print("Warning: \(failedCount) connections failed")
    
    if successfulConnections.isEmpty {
        throw ConnectionError.allConnectionsFailed
    }
}

// Continue with successful connections
for connection in successfulConnections {
    await performOperation(connection)
}
```

### Resource Management

```swift
// Limit concurrency to prevent resource exhaustion
let maxConcurrency = min(
    ProcessInfo.processInfo.activeProcessorCount, // CPU cores
    10, // Maximum connections
    servers.count // Server count
)

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: maxConcurrency
)
```

### Error Recovery

```swift
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

// Implement fallback strategy
func establishConnections() async throws -> [ChildChannelService<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>] {
    // Try parallel connection first
    let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
        to: servers,
        maxConcurrentConnections: 5
    )
    
    let successful = connections.compactMap { $0 }
    
    if successful.count >= servers.count / 2 {
        // At least half succeeded, continue
        return successful
    }
    
    // Fallback to sequential connection
    print("Parallel connection failed, trying sequential...")
    try await manager.connect(to: servers)
    
    // Return existing connections from cache
    return await manager.connectionCache.fetchAllConnections()
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

```swift
// Monitor memory usage with high concurrency
let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 10
)

// Each connection consumes memory, so monitor usage
let memoryUsage = ProcessInfo.processInfo.physicalMemory
print("Memory usage: \(memoryUsage / 1024 / 1024) MB")
```

### Network Bandwidth

```swift
// Consider network bandwidth when setting concurrency
let networkCapacity = estimateNetworkCapacity()
let optimalConcurrency = min(
    networkCapacity / 1000, // Assume 1MB per connection
    10
)

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: optimalConcurrency
)
```

### Connection Pooling Integration

```swift
// Use parallel connections with connection pooling
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

// Establish connections in parallel
let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 5
)

// Use pooled connections for operations
let poolConfig = ConnectionPoolConfiguration(maxPoolSize: 10)

for server in servers {
    let connection = await manager.connectionCache.acquireConnection(
        for: server.cacheKey,
        poolConfiguration: poolConfig
    )
    
    // Use connection
    await manager.connectionCache.returnConnection(connection, for: server.cacheKey)
}
```

## Error Handling

### Connection Timeout

```swift
let manager = ConnectionManager<ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer>()

// Handle connection timeouts
let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 5,
    retryStrategy: .fixed(delay: .seconds(2))
)

// Check for timeout-related failures
let timeoutFailures = connections.filter { connection in
    // Check if connection failed due to timeout
    return connection == nil
}

if !timeoutFailures.isEmpty {
    print("Warning: \(timeoutFailures.count) connections timed out")
}
```

### Network Errors

```swift
// Handle specific network errors
let customStrategy = RetryStrategy.custom { attempt, error in
    switch error {
    case is NetworkError:
        // Retry network errors with exponential backoff
        return .seconds(pow(2.0, Double(attempt)))
    case is TLSError:
        // Retry TLS errors with fixed delay
        return .seconds(5.0)
    default:
        // Don't retry other errors
        return nil
    }
}

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: servers,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 5,
    retryStrategy: customStrategy
)
```

## Integration Examples

### Microservices Architecture

```swift
// Connect to multiple microservices in parallel
let microservices = [
    ServerLocation(host: "auth-service", port: 8080, enableTLS: true, cacheKey: "auth"),
    ServerLocation(host: "user-service", port: 8081, enableTLS: true, cacheKey: "user"),
    ServerLocation(host: "payment-service", port: 8082, enableTLS: true, cacheKey: "payment"),
    ServerLocation(host: "notification-service", port: 8083, enableTLS: true, cacheKey: "notification")
]

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: microservices,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 4
)

// All microservices are now connected and ready
```

### Database Connection Pool

```swift
// Connect to multiple database replicas
let databaseReplicas = [
    ServerLocation(host: "db-primary", port: 5432, enableTLS: false, cacheKey: "db-primary"),
    ServerLocation(host: "db-replica-1", port: 5432, enableTLS: false, cacheKey: "db-replica-1"),
    ServerLocation(host: "db-replica-2", port: 5432, enableTLS: false, cacheKey: "db-replica-2")
]

let connections = try await manager.connectParallel(
    to: databaseReplicas,
    maxConcurrentConnections: 3
)

// Use connections for read/write operations
```
