import ServiceLifecycle

/// A service that manages the lifecycle of a child channel and its associated data streams.
///
/// `ChildChannelService` is responsible for managing individual network connections,
/// including setting up inbound and outbound data streams, handling channel lifecycle
/// events, and coordinating with delegates for custom behavior.
///
/// ## Key Features
/// - **Stream Management**: Handles inbound and outbound data streams
/// - **Lifecycle Coordination**: Manages channel initialization and shutdown
/// - **Delegate Integration**: Coordinates with connection and context delegates
/// - **Service Lifecycle**: Implements `Service` protocol for proper lifecycle management
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// let service = ChildChannelService(
///     logger: NeedleTailLogger(),
///     config: serverLocation,
///     childChannel: channel,
///     delegate: connectionManager
/// )
/// 
/// // Start the service
/// try await service.run()
/// 
/// // Update configuration
/// await service.setConfig(newConfig)
/// 
/// // Shutdown
/// try await service.shutdown()
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This class is implemented as an actor to ensure thread-safe access to its internal state.
/// - Note: The service automatically handles stream setup and cleanup when started or stopped.
