## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

- Follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use Swift 6.0+ features where appropriate
- Prefer async/await over completion handlers
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive documentation comments

### Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Add trailing commas for multi-line collections
- Use explicit type annotations when beneficial

### Architecture Principles

- Follow SOLID principles
- Use dependency injection
- Keep components loosely coupled
- Write testable code
- Document public APIs

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test
swift test --filter ConnectionManagerTests

# Run tests with verbose output
swift test --verbose
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Structure

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import ConnectionManagerKit

final class ConnectionManagerTests: XCTestCase {
    
    func testConnectionEstablishment() async throws {
        // Arrange
        let manager = ConnectionManager()
        
        // Act
        try await manager.connect(to: servers)
        
        // Assert
        XCTAssertTrue(manager.isConnected)
    }
}
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Use Swift DocC format
- Include usage examples
- Document parameters and return values
- Add `@available` annotations for platform-specific APIs

### Example Documentation

```swift
/// Manages network connections with automatic reconnection support.
///
/// The `ConnectionManager` provides a high-level interface for establishing
/// and maintaining network connections with built-in retry logic and
/// graceful error handling.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let manager = ConnectionManager()
/// try await manager.connect(to: servers)
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This class is thread-safe and can be used from multiple threads.
/// - Important: Always call `gracefulShutdown()` before deallocating.
@available(iOS 17.0, macOS 14.0, *)
public class ConnectionManager {
    // Implementation...
}
```

### Building Documentation

```bash
# Generate documentation
swift package generate-documentation

# Build documentation for specific target
swift package generate-documentation --target ConnectionManagerKit
```
